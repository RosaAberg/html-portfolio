<h1>The Best Movies According to Rosa</h1>
<h2>My to 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>The Usual Suspects</h3>
<p>It's smart and the first half hour is hilarious</p>

<h3>The Notebook</h3>
<p>I'm crying every single time</p>

<h3>The Abyss</h3>
<p>Saw it over and over as a kid but never the ending. Which was good because the ending sucked </p>
